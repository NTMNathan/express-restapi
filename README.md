<h1>Express Rest API</h1>

This is meant to be extremely lightweight to get you to understand how a Rest API basically works with little code written possible. There is two types of json responses which do the following:

- Returns a list of all values.
- Returns a random json value.

<hr>

All endpoints use the `GET` Method.
